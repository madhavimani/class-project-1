            <h1>Algebra</h1>
            <p>Algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with symbols and the rules for manipulating those symbols to solve equations and represent relationships. It serves as a foundational tool for expressing mathematical concepts and real-world situations in a concise way. By using variables to represent unknown quantities, algebra allows for the formulation of general principles and the ability to solve problems systematically. From simple equations to complex functions, algebra plays a crucial role in various fields, including science, engineering, economics, and everyday life, enabling us to analyze patterns and make informed decisions.</p>
