            <p id="paragraph">Algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with symbols and the rules for manipulating those symbols to solve equations and represent relationships. It serves as a foundational tool for expressing mathematical concepts and real-world situations in a concise way. By using variables to represent unknown quantities, algebra allows for the formulation of general principles and the ability to solve problems systematically.</p>
